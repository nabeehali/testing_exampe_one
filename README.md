# unit_testing_example_one

Welcome to the Flutter Software Testing Project repository! This project aims to demonstrate various software testing techniques and best practices in Flutter app development.

 
## Overview

This example demonstrates how to test methods such as validating emails using regular expressions (regex), reversing specific sentences, and converting them to lowercase and uppercase.

This project includes examples and implementations of different types of software testing in Flutter:

- Unit Testing
- Widget Testing
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End (E2E) Testing
  
## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `lib/`: Contains the main Flutter application code.
- `test/main_widget_test.dart/`: We Apply Widget tests.
- `test/reverse_string_unit_test.dart/`: Unit tests for Reverse function.
- `test/validate_email_string_unit_test.dart`: Unit tests for the Validation function.
- `test_driver/`: We Apply Integration tests.
  
## Testing Tools and Libraries
This project utilizes the following testing tools and libraries:

- `flutter_test`: Official Flutter testing library for unit and widget tests.
- `flutter_driver`: Flutter package for writing E2E tests using Flutter Driver.
- `test`: Dart testing library for writing tests and assertions.
